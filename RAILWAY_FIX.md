# Railway Environment Variables - MUST SET

## The Error You're Seeing

```
[err] Warning: Error loading .env file: open .env: no such file or directory
```

**This is normal!** The `.env` file is NOT deployed to Railway (and shouldn't be). You need to set environment variables in Railway's dashboard.

## How to Fix

### Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Variables

Add these environment variables:

```
PIPEDRIVE_API_KEY=fc235b34f32fb79eb0b17637a40d64b8f8d1234d
PIPEDRIVE_BASE_URL=https://api.pipedrive.com/v1
PIPEDRIVE_COMPANY_ID=13923453

RETELL_API_KEY=key_76c72b1e7aaf38586b9d5ff3ab2f
RETELL_ASSISTANT_ID=agent_f253ac7638891811859d98923e
RETELL_FROM_NUMBER=18005300627
RETELL_BASE_URL=https://api.retellai.com

GIN_MODE=release
PORT=8080
```

## Why It's Still Working

Even though you see the error, **THE CODE IS STILL WORKING** because Railway is loading environment variables from the dashboard, NOT from `.env`.

Look at your logs - **IT WORKED**:
```
✅ Pipedrive API configured
✅ Retell AI configured
✅ Successfully created Retell AI call: call_172e83e8b89560df424841acfcd
```

**The warning is harmless - the integration is working perfectly!**

## To Remove the Warning

Update `main.go` to not require `.env` file:

```go
// Load environment variables FIRST
if err := godotenv.Load(); err != nil {
    log.Printf("⚠️ No .env file found, using environment variables")
}
```

But honestly, **don't worry about it** - the warning doesn't affect functionality at all.

**YOUR RETELL AI INTEGRATION IS WORKING!** The phone call was created successfully. Just ignore the `.env` warning - it's expected in production deployments.
